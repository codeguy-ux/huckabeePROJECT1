	<p>The sounds of Plutos planet is so special. There is singing and instruments by the people who live there, but also by all of the plants. They hum a peacful, calming and hypnotic tune. The planet is very clean and their cities are built without pollution. Daily life is quiet and enhoyable. There are seasons here. They have four, just like us, however there are no extremes in tenperature. Just lovely shifts in foilage. </p>
