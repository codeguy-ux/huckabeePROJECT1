	<p>The home of Pluto's people, is in another universe. The rules of physics as we know it- do not apply. Their plant is covered in bright and colorful rainforest. the flowers look as if they are neon signs, they glow so brightly. it is a very safe and relaxing planet. everyone here works together to keep peace and love the center of society.</p>
